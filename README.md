# Personal-webstie

Full responsive using HTML, CSS and a little bit jQuery.

# Layout

I have used HTML5 semantic elements. All CSS code is written according to the BEM methodology.

# Adaptivity

I used @media queries to ensure that all page elements display correctly at any screen size.

# Animations

Every animation on this site has been created using CSS transitions so they run smoothly.

# Run & Build

This project is built using Gulp. You can run this site on your localhost after forking this repo, installing all dependencies "**npm i**" and typing in terminal "**gulp watch**".

See additional Gulp settings in [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/KonstHardy/personal-webstie/blob/master/gulpfile.js)

# personal-webstie

### Description

The personal website is fully responsive using HTML, CSS and jQuery a little bit.

### Layout

I used HTML5 semantic elements. All CSS code is written according to the BEM methodology.

### Adaptivity

I used [@media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) to ensure that all page elements display correctly at any screen size.

### Animations

Every animation on this site has been created using CSS transitions so they run smoothly.

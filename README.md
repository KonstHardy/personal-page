# personal-webstie

### Description

The personal website is fully responsive using HTML, CSS and jQuery a little bit.

### Layout

I used HTML5 semantic elements. All CSS code is written according to the BEM methodology.

### Adaptivity

I used [@media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) to ensure that all page elements display correctly at any screen size.

### Animations

Every animation on this site has been created using CSS transitions so they run smoothly.

### Preview

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run (in the terminal):

### `npm i`

This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on.

### `gulp`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See additional Gulp settings in [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/KonstHardy/personal-webstie/blob/master/gulpfile.js)

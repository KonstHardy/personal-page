# personal-webstie
Full responsive using HTML, CSS and a little bit jQuery

I used HTML5 semantic elements. All CSS code is written by BEM methodology

I used @media queries to make all elements of page displayed in right way on every screen size.

# animations
Every animation on this site was created using css transitions so they works smooth.
